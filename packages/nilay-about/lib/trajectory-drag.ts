/**
 * Drag coefficients of the standard projectiles G1 and G7, against Mach number.
 *
 * Transcribed from the tabulation JBM Ballistics distributes as `mcg1.txt` and `mcg7.txt`
 * (https://jbmballistics.com/downloads.html, retrieved 2026-09-22), where the site states
 * of these files: "I obtained the G functions and sphere from BRL", the US Army Ballistic
 * Research Laboratory that measured them. Every value here is that file's value: none was
 * interpolated, rounded or invented. The same standard drag functions are described in
 * Robert L. McCoy, "Modern Exterior Ballistics", 2nd ed., chapter 4, "Notes on Aerodynamic
 * Drag"; the numbers below are not taken from that book, so its tables are not the source
 * to check them against.
 *
 * Both tables give the drag coefficient of the standard projectile referred to its
 * frontal area, which is what a ballistic coefficient published in pounds per square
 * inch is measured against. G1 describes a flat-based projectile with a short nose and
 * suits pistol and older rifle bullets; G7 describes a boat-tailed projectile with a
 * long nose and fits modern match bullets far better over long distances.
 *
 * The Mach grid is deliberately uneven: it is dense through the transonic rise around
 * Mach 1, where the drag of G7 rises from 0.1660 to 0.4015 over a tenth of a Mach, and
 * sparse where the curve is nearly flat. The gap at Mach 0.65 in G1 and at Mach 1.45 in
 * G7 is in the published tables and is left as published rather than filled with a guess.
